Legends speak of the mysterious Myst Maze and the treasure held within.  Nobody has been able to navigate the traps and reach the end goal.  
One boy, armed with magical spells he found in the maze, plans on navigating it and reaching the treasure.
<br>
<br>
Use the WASD keys or the arrow keys to move.
<br>
<br>
To win the game, reach the ladder: <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Ladder.png>
<br>
<br>
Avoid the Fire Traps: <img src = http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Fire_Trap.png>
, the Pitfalls: <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Pitfall.png>
, and the Spike Traps <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Spike_Trap.png>
<br>
But if you want to win, you'll need to destroy them with spells you collect in the maze.
<br>
<br>
Fire traps are put out by Water Spells: <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Water.png> <br>
Pitfalls are teleported across with Teleport Spells: <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Teleport.png> <br>
And Spike Traps are Burnt to a Crisp with Fire Spells: <img src= http://gide.myglife.org/file/Nwilliams-OrionContent/ActionGame/images/Game_Art/Fireball.png> <br>
<br>
After you've collected a spell, move your cursor over the correct trap and press "Q" to destroy it.
<br>
You've already collected a teleport spell before reaching the maze, but you'll have to collect the rest yourself.
